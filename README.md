# Tutorial-Bootstrap

# Before we start we assume that you already have "npm install" we will use "npx", if you have a version 5 of "npm" by default you should have "npx".
# If you don't have npm, download it from this link: : https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# To create the react application we use the following command we replace [file_name] with the name you want to put in your project.
# EX: npx create-react-app bootstrap5-react.

    npx create-react-app [file_name] 

# Now that we have created the project before starting we have to add boostrap for that we use the following commands.
# First if you don't have yarn installed use the following command in the terminal

    npm install -g yarn

# Now we add booster to the project using the following parameters 

    yarn add bootstrap react-bootstrap
